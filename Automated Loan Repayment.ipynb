    "# Predicting Loan Repayment with Automated Feature Engineering in Featuretools\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature engineering is the process of creating new features (also called predictors or explanatory variables) out of an existing dataset. Traditionally, this process is done by hand using domain knowledge to build new features one at a time. In a previous notebook, we saw that feature engineering is crucial for a data science problem and how the manual approach is time-consuming, tedious, error-prone, and must be re-done for each problem. Automated feature engineering aims to aid the data scientist in this critical process by automatically creating hundreds or thousands of new features from a set of related tables in a fraction of the time as the manual approach. In this notebook, we will apply automated feature engineering to the Home Credit Default Risk loan dataset using [Featuretools, an open-source Python library](https://www.featuretools.com/) for automated feature engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is a machine learning competition currently running on Kaggle where the objective is to predict if an applicant will default on a loan given comprehensive data on past loans and applicants. The data is spread across seven different tables making this an ideal problem for automated feature engineering: all of the data must be gathered into a single dataframe for training (and one for testing) with the aim of capturing as much usable information for the prediction problem as possible. As we will see, featuretools can efficiently carry out the tedious process of using all of these tables to make new features with only a few lines of code. Moreover, this code is generally applicable to any data science problem! \n",

    "## Approach \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will implement an automated feature engineering approach to the loan repayment problem. While Featuretools allows plenty of options for customization of the library to improve accuracy, we'll focus on a fairly high-level implementation. (Later notebooks, including Engine Life and Retail Spending show some of the additional features of the library).\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach will be as follows with the background covered as we go:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read in the set of related data tables\n",
    "2. Create a featuretools `EntitySet` and add `entities` to it \n",
    "    * Identify correct variable types as required\n",
    "    * Identify indices in data\n",
    "3. Add relationships between `entities`\n",
    "4. Select feature primitives to use to create new features\n",
    "    * Use basic set of primitives\n",
    "    * Examine features that will be created\n",
    "5. Run Deep Feature Synthesis to generate thousands of new features\n",

    "The [Home Credit Default Risk competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) currently running on Kaggle is a supervised classification task where the objective is to predict whether or not an applicant for a loan (known as a client) will default on the loan. The data comprises socio-economic indicators for the clients, loan specific financial information, and comprehensive data on previous loans at Home Credit (the institution sponsoring the competition) and other credit agencies. The metric for this competition is Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC) with predictions made in terms of the probability of default. We can evaluate our submissions both through cross-validation on the training data (for which we have the labels) or by submitting our test predictions to Kaggle to see where we place on the public leaderboard (which is calculated with only 10% of the testing data). \n",
    "\n",
    "The Home Credit Default Risk dataset ([available for download here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data)) consists of seven related tables of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "* application_train/application_test: the main training/testing data for each client at Home Credit. The information includes both socioeconomic indicators for the client and loan-specific characteristics. Each loan has its own row and is uniquely identified by the feature `SK_ID_CURR`. The training application data comes with the `TARGET` indicating 0: the loan was repaid or 1: the loan was not repaid. \n",
    "* bureau: data concerning client's previous credits from other financial institutions (not Home Credit). Each previous credit has its own row in bureau, but one client in the application data can have multiple previous credits. The previous credits are uniquely identified by the feature `SK_ID_BUREAU`.\n",
    "* bureau_balance: monthly balance data about the credits in bureau. Each row has information for one month about a previous credit and a single previous credit can have multiple rows. This is linked backed to the bureau loan data by `SK_ID_BUREAU` (not unique in this dataframe).\n",
    "* previous_application: previous applications for loans at Home Credit of clients who have loans in the application data. Each client in the application data can have multiple previous loans. Each previous application has one row in this dataframe and is uniquely identified by the feature `SK_ID_PREV`. \n",
    "* POS_CASH_BALANCE: monthly data about previous point of sale or cash loans from the previous loan data. Each row is one month of a previous point of sale or cash loan, and a single previous loan can have many rows. This is linked backed to the previous loan data by `SK_ID_PREV` (not unique in this dataframe).\n",
    "* credit_card_balance: monthly data about previous credit cards loans from the previous loan data. Each row is one month of a credit card balance, and a single credit card can have many rows. This is linked backed to the previous loan data by `SK_ID_PREV` (not unique in this dataframe).\n",
    "* installments_payment: payment history for previous loans at Home Credit. There is one row for every made payment and one row for every missed payment. This is linked backed to the previous loan data by `SK_ID_PREV` (not unique in this dataframe).\n",

    "# Featuretools Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "[Featuretools](https://docs.featuretools.com/#minute-quick-start) is an open-source Python library for automatically creating features out of a set of related tables using a technique called [Deep Feature Synthesis](http://www.jmaxkanter.com/static/papers/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf). Automated feature engineering, like many topics in machine learning, is a complex subject built upon a foundation of simpler ideas. By going through these ideas one at a time, we can build up our understanding of Featuretools which will later allow for us to get the most out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few concepts that we will cover along the way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Entities and EntitySets](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html): our tables and a data structure for keeping track of them all\n",
    "* [Relationships between tables](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html#adding-a-relationship): how the tables can be related to one another\n",
    "* [Feature primitives](https://docs.featuretools.com/automated_feature_engineering/primitives.html): aggregations and transformations that are stacked to build features\n",
    "* [Deep feature synthesis](https://docs.featuretools.com/automated_feature_engineering/afe.html): the method that uses feature primitives to generate thousands of new features\n",
    "\n",
    "# Entities and Entitysets\n",
    "\n",
    "An entity is simply a table or in Pandas, a `dataframe`. The observations must be in the rows and the features in the columns. An entity in featuretools must have a unique index where none of the elements are duplicated.  Currently, only `app`, `bureau`, and `previous` have unique indices (`SK_ID_CURR`, `SK_ID_BUREAU`, and `SK_ID_PREV` respectively). For the other dataframes, when we create entities from them, we must pass in `make_index = True` and then specify the name of the index. \n",
    "\n",
    "Entities can also have time indices that represent when the information in the row became known. (There are not datetimes in any of the data, but there are relative times, given in months or days, that could be treated as time variables, although we will not use them as time in this notebook).\n",
    "\n",
    "An [EntitySet](https://docs.featuretools.com/loading_data/using_entitysets.html) is a collection of tables and the relationships between them. This can be thought of a data structure with its own methods and attributes. Using an EntitySet allows us to group together multiple tables and will make creating the features much simpler than keeping track of individual tables and relationships. __EntitySets and entities are abstractions that can be applied to any dataset because they do not depend on the underlying data.__\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll make an empty entityset named clients to keep track of all the data."

    "\n",
    "We will first work with the `app` data to specify the proper variable types. To identify the `Boolean` variables that are recorded as numbers (1.0 or 0.0), we can iterate through the data and find any columns where there are only 2 unique values and the data type is numeric. We can also use the column definitions to find any other data types that should be identified, such as `Ordinal` variables. Identifying the correct variable types is important because Featuretools applies different operations to different data types (just as we do when manual feature engineering)."

    "Relationships are a fundamental concept not only in featuretools, but in any relational database. The most common type of relationship is one-to-many. The best way to think of a one-to-many relationship is with the analogy of parent-to-child. A parent is a single individual, but can have mutliple children. In the context of tables, a parent table will have one row (observation) for every individual while a child table can have many observations for each parent.  In a _parent table_, each individual has a single row and is uniquely identified by an index (also called a key). Each individual in the parent table can have multiple rows in the _child table_. Things get a little more complicated because children tables can have children of their own, making these grandchildren of the original parent. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of a parent-to-child relationship, the `app` dataframe has one row for each client (identified by `SK_ID_CURR`) while the `bureau` dataframe has multiple previous loans for each client. Therefore, the `bureau` dataframe is the child of the `app` dataframe. The `bureau` dataframe in turn is the parent of `bureau_balance` because each loan has one row in `bureau` (identified by `SK_ID_BUREAU`) but multiple monthly records in `bureau_balance`. When we do manual feature engineering, keeping track of all these relationships is a massive time investment (and a potential source of error), but we can add these relationships to our `EntitySet` and let featuretools worry about keeping the tables straight!"

For example, we might group together all the loans for a single client and calculate the average loan amount. This is straightforward, but can grow extremely tedious when we want to make hundreds of these features.

    "__Slightly advanced note__: we need to be careful to not create a [diamond graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_graph) where there are multiple paths from a parent to a child. If we directly link `app` and `cash` via `SK_ID_CURR`; `previous` and `cash` via `SK_ID_PREV`; and `app` and `previous` via `SK_ID_CURR`, then we have created two paths from `app` to `cash`. This results in ambiguity, so the approach we have to take instead is to link `app` to `cash` through `previous`. We establish a relationship between `previous` (the parent) and `cash` (the child) using `SK_ID_PREV`. Then we establish a relationship between `app` (the parent) and `previous` (now the child) using `SK_ID_CURR`. Then featuretools will be able to create features on `app` derived from both `previous` and `cash` by stacking multiple primitives. \n",

    "# Deep Feature Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "[Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS)](https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/deep-feature-synthesis/) is the method Featuretools uses to make new features. DFS stacks feature primitives to form features with a \"depth\" equal to the number of primitives. For example, if we take the maximum value of a client's previous loans (say `MAX(previous.loan_amount)`), that is a \"deep feature\" with a depth of 1. To create a feature with a depth of two, we could stack primitives by taking the maximum value of a client's average monthly payments per previous loan (such as `MAX(previous(MEAN(installments.payment)))`). In manual feature engineering, this would require two separate groupings and aggregations and took more than 15 minutes to write the code per feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Feature Synthesis is an extremely powerful method that allows us to overcome our human limitations on time and creativity by building features that we would never be able to think of on our own (or would not have the patience to implement). Furthermore, DFS is applicable to any dataset with only very minor changes in syntax. In feature engineering, we generally apply the same functions to multiple datasets, but when we do it by hand, we have to re-write the code because it is problem-specific. Featuretools code can be applied to any dataset because it is written at a higher level of abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [original paper on automated feature engineering using Deep Feature Synthesis](https://dai.lids.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/DSAA_DSM_2015.pdf) is worth a read if you want to understand the concepts at a deeper level.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform DFS in featuretools, we use the `dfs`  function passing it an `entityset`, the `target_entity` (where we want to make the features), the `agg_primitives` to use, the `trans_primitives` to use, the `max_depth` of the features, and a number of other arguments depending on our use case. There are also options for multi-processing with `njobs` and the information that is printed out with `verbose`. \n",
    "\n",
    "One other important argument is __`features_only`__. If we set this to `True`, `dfs` will only make the feature names and not calculate the actual values of the features (called the feature matrix). This is useful when we want to inspect the feature that will be created and we can also save the features to use with a different dataset (for example when we have training and testing data)."

For example, we might want to find for each client the mean amount of previous loans that have been closed and the mean amount of previous loans that are still active. By specifying interesting values in `bureau` on the `CREDIT_ACTIVE` variable we can have Featuretools do exactly that!

    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we saw how to implement automated feature engineering for a data science problem. __Automated feature engineering allows us to create thousands of new features from a set of related data tables, significantly increasing our efficiency as data scientists.__ Moreover, we can still use domain knowledge in our features and even augment our domain knowledge by building on top of our own hand-built features. The main takeaways are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Automated feature engineering took 1 hour to implement compared to 10 hours for manual feature engineering\n",
    "* Automated feature engineering built thousands of features in a few lines of code compared to dozens of lines of code per feature for manual engineering.\n",
    "* Overall, performance of the automated features are comparable or better than those of the manual features (see the Results notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of automated feature engineering are significant and will considerably help us in our role as data scientists. It won't alleviate the need for data scientists, but rather will make us more efficient and build better predictive pipelines in less time. "

    "After creating a full set of features, we can apply feature selection and then proceed with modeling. To optimize the model for the features, we use random search for 100 iterations over a grid of hyperparamters. To see how to use Dask to run Featuretools in parallel, refer to the Featuretools Implementation with Dask notebook. For feature selection refer to the Feature Selection notebook. Final results are presented in the Results notebook."
